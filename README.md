# Fine-tuning LLAMA with custom dataset - Prasanth Learning

This repository contains the source code for fine-tuning the LLAMA (Long-range Large Memory Attention) model with a custom dataset. The project is part of Prasanth's learning journey in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## Project Overview
The project aims to harness the power of the LLAMA model, adapt it to specific use cases, and achieve state-of-the-art performance through supervised fine-tuning[^1^][2].
